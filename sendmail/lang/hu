access_desc1=Sendmail's spam control feature allows you to prevent spam from reaching your users by rejecting mail from certain addresses, and to prevent spammers from using your system to relay mail. By default sendmail will accept mail from any address for a local user, but prevent any client or mail server from relaying mail through your system. Typically you would add spam control rules to reject mail from spammers, and rules to allow other machines on your network to relay mail through your system.
access_desc2=Note that sendmail will by default allow mail clients running on your system to relay mail via SMTP to any destination. Thus there is no need to add the local <tt>127.0.0</tt> network to the list of those allowed to relay.

<header>Cluster Firewall Servers</header>

This page can be used to push your firewall configuration out to several systems
simultaneously, so that you can manage a cluster of firewall systems from a single
interface. Before a server can be added to this page, it must have Webmin 1.170 or
above installed and be added in the Webmin Servers Index module. It must also have the
necessary <tt>ipi(6)tables</tt> programs installed and properly configured. <p>

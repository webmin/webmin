<header>Brukere og grupper</header>

<h3>Introduksjon til brukere</h3>
A Unix user is typically someone who can login to the system, either
remotely via telnet or at the console. Every file is owned by some user,
and every process runs with the rights of some user. Access to files and
processes is determined by the user you are logged in as. <p>

There are really three types of users on a typical Unix system :
<ul>
<li><b>Administrative Users</b><br>
    Accounts like <tt>bin</tt>, <tt>lp</tt> and <tt>uccp</tt> own files
    such as the standard commands in <tt>/bin</tt>, print spool files and
    UUCP data. Actually logging in with one of these accounts is not
    normally allowed - they are used only by various system processes.
    These users will be created when the operating system is first installed.<p>
<li><b>Real People</b><br>
    These are accounts owned by real users, created by the system
    administrator. You may allow these users to login remotely, or maybe
    let them only to send and receive mail via SMTP and POP3. <p>
<li><b>The <tt>root</tt> User</b><br>
    The <tt>root</tt> user has the power to read and write any file
    or directory and control any process. This account is typically used
    for system administration purposes, and is the account under which
    Webmin runs. <p>
</ul>

At the top of the main page of this module is a table of existing users
on your system. You may click on a user to edit it, or click on the link
below the table to create a new user. Users whose login names are shown in
italics are those whose passwords are temporarily disabled. <p>

<h3>Introduction to Groups</h3>
A group is simply a list of Unix users. Every user has belongs to at least
one group (their primary group), and optionally several others. All files
are owned by some group, and every process runs with the permissions of
a group. <p>

Below the list of users is a table of existing groups. You may click on
a group name to edit it, or click on the link below the table to create
a new group. <p>

<h3>Recorded Logins</h3>
Every time a user logs in by telnet, FTP or at the console the system records
that login and the subsequent logout. At the bottom of the main page is
a small form that allows you to display logins either by everyone, or by
a selected user. <p>

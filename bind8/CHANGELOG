---- Changes since 1.130 ----
A new Module Config option is available to define extra DNS record types for the module to support in a generic way. This allows user who want to create obscure types like NAPTR, KEY and so on to do so.
---- Changes since 1.140 ----
Added an ACL option to limit allowed record types.
Views are now added to the file specified in the Module Config, rather than to named.conf.

Added a button for selecting a free IP address when adding Address records, and a Module Config page option for entering IP allocation ranges.
Added basic support for delegation-only zones.
Created two new bind8-lib.pl functions for creating and deleting slave zones, for use by remote callers to avoid transferring large amounts of data via RPC calls.
If the rndc command is installed but does not re-load a zone properly, the ndc command will be attempted as well if possible.
---- Changes since 1.160 ----
Added a Module Config option to control whether or not the PID file is under the chroot directory.

Basic information about all domains is now kept in a separate cache file, which can be read faster than the primary named.conf file. This speeds up the zone list and editing of records on systems that have a large number of domains.
More than one slave server to add new master zones to can now be defined, and zones will be added, deleted and applied on all at once. When a slave is added, existing master zones can also be converted to new slave zones on it.
Multiple master, slave or forward zones can now be created at once from a batch file, using a new link on the module's index page.
When a list view is used for zones, several can now be selected at once and deleted using a single button.
---- Changes since 1.210 ----
Added a new page for setting up RNDC on BIND version 9, so that individual zones can be reloaded.
Updated the Control Interface Options to be more consistent with the rest of the module.
Added support for easily creating SPF records. Even though these are really TXT records, they now appear as a separate type in this module.

Moved the option for the default nameserver for new master domains to the Zone Defaults page, where it is more obvious.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----

When deleting a zone, the .log or .jnl file created by BIND for dynamic DNS updates is also removed.
Added an icon for manually editing the BIND master configuration file.
Reverse IPs are updated even when the forward record names are not fully canonicalized.
Added an ACL option to allow a Webmin user to apply the BIND configuration, but not stop or start the server.
---- Changes since 1.260 ----
When adding a cluster slave DNS server, you can specify that slave zones created locally should also be created on the slave too, with the same settings.
Added a Module Config option to not read or display records in a zone by default, which speeds up the process of adding records to very large zones. Thanks to Walgreens for sponsoring this feature.
When deleting multiple Address records, their corresponding reverse records can be deleted as well.
Cluster slave DNS servers can have an alternative hostname specified, for use in the NS records on the master when a new zone is added.
Added a field on the Addresses and Topology page for controlling which clients can make recursive queries.
When an automatic filename is chosen for a zone added to a view, the view name is included in order to avoid clashes.

When adding a remote slave zone, the IPs of all other slaves and the master are included in the master IPs list.
---- Changes since 1.390 ----
BIND on Windows can now be configured using this module.
Mass record creation can now add records for the domain name (by entering @ as the name), as records that already exist.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
Keys in ACL sections are no long mangled by Webmin. This means that each IP or key must be entered on a separate line in the Access Control Lists page.
---- Changes since 1.410 ----
Corrected parsing of records in zone files with no names, which inherit from the previous record.
Spaces are now allowed in Host Information records.
---- Changes since 1.420 ----
The default TTL for multiple zones can now be changed on the Update Records in Zones page.
When adding a cluster slave server, multiple views can be entered to have slave zones created in all of them.
Record names or values entered like ns.foo.com in the domain foo.com automatically have a . added to make them absolute as the user presumably expected, rather than being converted to ns.foo.com.foo.com.
Update serial number (by default) when editing records manually.
Try downloading root zone files from the IP for rs.internic.net if the hostname cannot be resolved, to avoid catch-22 problem.

Moved buttons for deleting, moving and converting zones up to the page shown when you click on a zone name.
Switched to the new root zone file available from Internic.
Restrictions that apply to all zones in a view (such as allowed IPs for transfers and queries) can now be set on the Edit Client View page.
Made the Find Free IPs page visible, for finding addresses in a master zone that are not currently used.
Added a field to limit concurrent outgoing zone transfers and incoming transfers per nameserver to the Forwarding and Transfers page.
Ignore tailing dots in zone names in named.conf.
---- Changes since 1.440 ----
Moved the apply, stop and start buttons to the top-right corner of every page, so that you don't have to return all the way to the module's main page to apply configuration changes.
Zones can now be signed with DNSSEC, using one or two keys. This can be done automatically at master zone creation time, or later for existing zones. Signatures can also be removed or re-generated at any time. Zones with a key-signing and zone key can have their zone key automatically regenated on a regular interval.
Added the DNSSEC Verification page for configuring BIND to validate signatures on other zones, and to use DLV until the root zone is signed.
SPF records can now be added to or updated in multiple zones at once.
Added an icon to the main page for checking the whole BIND configuration including zone files, with the named-checkconf command.

Fixed a bug that cause blocks like sortlist not be parsed properly, and possible cause Webmin to corrupt other parts of the named.conf file.
Redirect and explanation modifiers can be viewed and edited in SPF records.
Added a Module Config option for additional master IP addresses for remote slave zones.
If nscd is running when BIND is restarted or a zone is applied, it will be signalled to re-read DNS caches too.

---- Changes since 1.580 ----
The source IP and port for zone transfers can now be specific on the Addresses and Topology page.
Added support for zone signing using the DNSSEC-Tools suite, thanks to a patch from Suresh Krishnaswamy.
---- Changes since 1.600 ----
Changed all links to zones to use the zone name instead of an index, to prevent incorrect modification during concurrent access to the module.
---- Changes since 1.620 ----
Added a module configuration option to use the SPF type for Sender Permitted From records.
---- Changes since 1.660 ----
Added a warning if the chroot directory that Webmin thinks BIND is using looks wrong.
Slave zone files in raw format can now be displayed by Webmin.
---- Changes since 1.720 ----
Added support for NSEC3PARAM records.
---- Changes since 1.730 ----
Added support for editing DMARC records, which are specially encoded TXT records for defining the response to SPF and DKIM violations.

<header>Hostsentry Configuration</header>

Hostsentry is a host based intrusion detection tool that performs login
anomaly detection. This means that it monitors users logging into and out
of your server and logs suspicious behaviour, as defined by the options
chosen on this page. <p>

The available options are :
<ul>
<li><b>Logins record file</b><br>
    The file on your system in which logins and logouts are recorded. Generally,
    this option should not be changed. <p>

<li><b>Users to ignore logins by</b><br>
    Any users listed in this field will not have their logins monitored by
    Hostsentry. <p>

<li><b>Hostsentry modules in processing order</b><br>
    Hostsentry has a modular design, in which each module performs a specific
    type of login anomaly detection. This section allows you to choose which
    modules are used, and the order in which they are run to process logins
    and logouts. <p>

<li><b>Hosts not to consider foreign</b><br>
    If the 'Detect login from foreign domain' module is enabled, all hosts
    except those in this field will be considered foreign and thus subject
    to reporting. <p>

<li><b>Hosts to trust multiple logins from</b><br>
    If the 'Detect multiple simultaneous logins' module is enabled, two or
    more logins by the same user at the same time from a host not in this
    list will be reported. <p>
</ul>

At the bottom of the page is a button for either starting Hostsentry (if it
is not running), or stopping it (if it is running). Because Hostsentry runs
as a background process (or daemon), if it is not running no monitoring of
logins and logouts will be done. <p>

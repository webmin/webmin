When a virtual server in it's own private config file is deleted, the entire file will be removed to avoid leaving empty .conf files around.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----
Apache -D variables are now automatically detected on SuSE, Redhat and Mandrake systems, rather than needing to be entered manually.

---- Changes since 1.250 ----
Added a Module Config option for a directory to symlink new virtual host files from, to support the configuration system used by Debian Linux.
Added checkboxes and a button to the module's main page for deleting multiple virtual hosts at once.

Available Apache modules are now fully automatically detected on all operating systems, which does away with the Re-Configure Known Modules page.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
Moved the SSL password option to the global settings level, to correspond with the way Apache expects it.
---- Changes since 1.410 ----
Added support for the funny ${APACHE_RUN_USER} and ${APACHE_PID_FILE} variables seen in apache2.conf on Ubuntu 8.04.
---- Changes since 1.430 ----
When a virtual host's base directory is changed, all <directory> blocks under it are updated too.

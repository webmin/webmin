index_vgsdesc=A volume group is a set of disks that can be allocated to one or more logical volumes. Most systems will have only one, and at least one must be created before any physical or logical volumes can be added.
index_pvsdesc=A physical volume is a disk partition or RAID device that is part of a volume group. Its disk space can then be used by one or more logical volumes.
index_lvsdesc=A logical volume is a virtual partition created from the combined disk space of a volume group. Each can have a filesystem which is then mounted to store files.

---- Changes since 1.240 ----
First version of this module, which allows simple Procmail configuration.
---- Changes since 1.260 ----
Added a message to the module's main page to detect system-level mail aliases (in /etc/aliases) that would forward email to the user to a different destination.
---- Changes since 1.280 ----
Added an option to set the date range for which autoreplies are sent.
Added a simple page for setting up an email autoresponder.
Display a warning if /etc/procmailrc is setup to always deliver to the inbox, which would prevent user-defined filters from working.
If email classified as spam is delivered to some folder by a global Procmail configuration (either in /etc/procmailrc or a Virtualmin per-domain setting), display this on the list of filters.
Changed the module name to Filter and Forward Mail.
Added a simple page for setting up forwarding.

The default From: address for autoreplies now respects the default address set in the user's address book.

Autoreply messages containing non-ASCII characters are now properly quoted-printable encoded.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----

When an autoreply is deleted, the underlying message file is deleted too.

---- Changes since 1.450 ----
Added option to select the character set of automatic reply messages.
---- Changes since 1.460 ----
Added a checkbox (on by default) to not forward bounce emails, which can cause mail loops.

The time between autoreplies to the same address now defaults to 1 hour.
---- Changes since 1.560 ----
Added buttons on the Edit Filter page to show all email matching a filter, or apply the filter to email in some folder.

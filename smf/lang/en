whats_this_stateinfo=Displayed is information pertaining to the service instance state, as garnered from the svcs command. See: svcs(1). See: smf(5).
whats_this_extraopts=Check these additional options, and click Update View if you want to see them in the service listing below. The meaning of the options can be found in the svcs manpage. See: svcs(1).
whats_this_enabledonly=Select whether you want enabled services only to be displayed, or if you want all services (enabled and disabled) in the listing.
whats_this_create_new_service=Click here if you want to add a new service.
whats_this_serviceviewer=The service viewer provides a categorical view of the services available/running on the system and their states, based on the listing provided by the svcs command. Clicking on a particular tab shows services specific to that category, e.g. Network holds all services of the form svc:/network. Multiple enable/disable/refresh/restart/maintenance/degraded/clear/delete operations can be carried out by checking the candidate service instances and clicking the relevant apply button. Individual services/instances can be edited by clicking on the fmri or instance respectively, and the state of an individual service instance can be examined by clicking on the state. See: svcs(1).
whats_this_apply=You can carry out operations on multiple items in the service listing by checking the appropriate services and using these buttons. See: svcadm(1M).
whats_this_FMRI=The FMRI is a Universal Resource Indicator (URI) that specifies a particular service. Under the 'All' list, the full FMRI is displayed, but under particular service categories, e.g. network, the network category is not displayed. Clicking on a particular service FMRI will bring you to the service viewer where you can edit that service's properties with immediate effect (so be careful!). See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_INST=The instance is the instance name associated with the service FMRI adjacent. A given service may have multiple instances. Clicking on the instance will bring you to the service viewer, but will only allow you to update properties for that instance. If you want to update service-level and other instance properties, click on the service FMRI. See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_STATE=The state of the particular instance. The meanings of the various states are described in the smf manpage. See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_DESC=A textual description of the service. See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_NSTATE=The next state of the service, useful when the service is transitioning. A '-' indicates it is not transitioning. See: svcs(1).
whats_this_SCOPE=The scope name of the service instance. See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_STIME=The time (if today) or date the service entered the current state. See: smf(5). See: svcs(1).
whats_this_Select=Check the list of services you want to enable/disable/refresh etc here.

whats_this_service_detail=Specify/edit toplevel service information here: service name, version number, bundle name for manifest and stability. See: smf(5). See: svccfg(1M). See: service_bundle(4).
whats_this_bundle_name=Name of service bundle in manifest. Multiple services can be bundled in the one manifest, but the name here isnt important. For already-existing services, it will be set to export as this is what svccfg does when it exports a manifest from the SMF repository. See: svccfg(1M). See: service_bundle(4).
whats_this_service_name=Name of service. Convention is to use the format [general_service_category]/[name]. Categories already provided include application (higher-level applications), milestone (collections of other services, such as name services), platform (platform-specific services), system (Solaris system services), device (device-specific services), network (network/internet services) and site (site-sepecific descriptions). You can also specify your own category of course, but most services should fit comfortably in one of the above. See: smf(5).
whats_this_service_version=Specify the version number of the service.
whats_this_instance_detail=Specify/edit instance information here: instance name and whether it is to be enabled by default or not. See: smf(5).
whats_this_instance_name=Specify the instance name. Services with only one instance generally use default as the instance name (e.g. inetd). Services which allow multiple instances of the same binary running with different configurations will require multiple instances, e.g. the chargen inetd service, which requires a stream and datagram-based version running on different ports. See: smf(5).
whats_this_instance_enabled=Specify if you want this service instance to be enabled by default or not.
whats_this_serv_instname=Specify whether you want to update information at the service or instance level. If a property, dependency etc exists at both the service and instance level, the instance-level value is used for that specific instance, otherwise it inherits the service-level value. This allows instances to selectively inherit values from the service-level specification, while being able to set values that they may require uniquely.
whats_this_stability=Specify the stability value, - means leave unset.
whats_this_fmri=Specify the relevant service/instance FMRI.
whats_this_restarter_detail=By default, services use the master restarter (system/restarter service) to control their behaviour. Delegated restarters such as inetd can also be specified. As the name suggests, this involves relying on the delegated restarter to handle start/stop of services, and in the case of inetd these methods have different names to differentiate from master restarter-based services. See: inetd(1M). See: svc.startd(1M). See: smf_restarter(5).
whats_this_exec_detail=Execute methods are the heart of an smf service, it is where you specify what programs to run on start/stopping the service. Services that use a delegated restarter (like inetd) have their own start/stop methods (e.g. inetd_start, inetd_stop), but services using the master restarter will generally specify a start and stop method at a minimum. See: svc.startd(1M). See: smf_method(5). See: inetd(1M).
whats_this_exec_name=Provide a unique name for this execute method here. For services using the master restarter, start and stop methods are mandatory, and run respectively when the service is enabled and dependencies met; when a dependency goes offline, the service fails, the adminstrator disables the service etc. See: smf_method(5). See: inetd(1M).
whats_this_exec_timeout_seconds=Methods that exceed their timeouts will be killed. For unbounded methods, set timeout to 0.
whats_this_exec_exec=Provide path to execute method plus arguments. Keywords :kill and :true are provided and can be used as exec methods. The former kills all process started by the service, the latter simply returns success to the restarter. Method tokens can also be used to pass smf-related info to the method. See: smf_method(5).
whats_this_exec_user=Specify an override to the default method enviroment value for user (the default method environment is inherited from init).
whats_this_exec_group=Specify an override to the default method enviroment valuefor group (the default method environment is inherited from init). 
whats_this_exec_privileges=Specify an override to the default method enviroment privileges.
whats_this_depy_detail=Dependencies provide a way of specifying what services your service requires to be (sometimes not) running before it runs. Calling out dependencies is one of the key benefits of SMF, as it imposes a deterministic structure on what was a very tangled web of init scripts etc. Dependencies provide a lot of flexibility in that you can specify that your service will wait for a particular dependency to come online, wait for one member of a group (e.g. whichever nameservice is configured), or even only run if another service isnt running. See: smf(5).
whats_this_depy_name=Provide a unique name for this dependency here.
whats_this_depy_type=Select dependency type (path or service). Path dependencies require the named file to be in place (?). An example of a valid fmri for a path dependency would be file:://localhost/path2file. Service dependencies are just fmris identifying the service depended upon.
whats_this_depy_grouping=Select a grouping value for your dependency. Grouping values determine the nature of the dependency relation. For example, for require_all, all dependencies in group need to be online/degraded before the service starts, while for require_any, any of the group are required to be online/degraded. For optional_all, all enabled and able-to-run services must be online, while for exclude_all, if the dependency is online/degraded, the service should not be run.
whats_this_depy_restart_on=Specify the fault propogation model here, i.e. how should my service react to faults in the dependency? Values are none (we dont care about the dependency after startup), fault (restart if the dependency has a fault), restart (restart if the dependency is restarted), and refresh (restart if the dependency is refreshed).
whats_this_dept_detail=Dependents might seem a little confusing - why have a mechanism to specify what services depend on my service, cant i just add a dependency in the candidate dependent? Dependents address the situation where you dont own the dependent manifest and cant do this. As a consequence, dependents look very much like dependencies, but rather than specifying that the current service depends on this dependency, we are saying that the current service is a dependency for this child service/dependent. See: smf(5).
whats_this_dept_name=Provide a unique name for this dependent here.
whats_this_dept_grouping=Select a grouping value which this service will adhere to for its dependent.  Grouping values determine the nature of the dependency relation. For example, for require_all, all services in the group that specify the dependent need to be online/degraded before the dependent starts, while for require_any, any of the group are required to be online/degraded. For optional_all, all enabled and able-to-run services must be online, while for exclude_all, if the service is online/degraded, the dependent service should not be run.
whats_this_dept_restart_on=Specify the fault propogation model here, i.e. how should this service propogate faults to its dependent?  Values are none (dependent doesnt care about the service after startup), fault (restart dependent if the service has a fault), restart (restart dependent if the service is restarted), and refresh (restart dependent if the service is refreshed).
whats_this_pgroup_detail=In smf, all service information, dependencies, exec methods etc are stored as properties within property groups. In addition, services may need to specify other properties, e.g. inetd services need to specify properties that the inetd delegated restarter understands and needs. Services can also store their own application data in properties. See: smf(5).
whats_this_pgroup_name=Specify property group name. See: smf(5).
whats_this_pgroup_type=Specify property group type. See: smf(5).
whats_this_sinst_pgroup_name=Select property group at appropriate service/instance level. This allows creation/update of properties at both instance-specific and service level.
whats_this_prop_detail=Properties are associated with property groups and used to store service-relevant information. See: smf(5).
whats_this_prop_name=Specify property name. See: smf(5).
whats_this_prop_type=Specify property type. Valid types are count, integer, opaque, host, hostname, net_address_v4, net_address_v6, time, astring, ustring, boolean, fmri, uri. See: smf(5).
whats_this_prop_value=Specify property value. See: smf(5).
whats_this_man_detail=Provide information regarding manpage documentation for service. See: man(1).
whats_this_man_title=Specify manpage title. See: man(1).
whats_this_man_section=Specify manpage section. See: man(1).
whats_this_man_manpath=Specify manpath. See: man(1).
whats_this_template_detail=Provide details of service, its commonly used name and a description of what the service does.
whats_this_template_common_name=Specify common name for service.
whats_this_template_description=Describe the service.

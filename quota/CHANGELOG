---- Changes since 1.140 ----
Fixed a bug that prevented the editing of quotas on loopback filesystems under Linux.
---- Changes since 1.150 ----
Quotas and usage are now displayed in bytes, kB, MB or GB where appropriate, instead of always kilobytes.
The quotaon -p command is now used to determine if quotas are active or not for some filesystem, which is faster and more reliable.
---- Changes since 1.160 ----
Email notification can be set up for users that are close to or have reached their soft or hard limit, on a per-filesystem basis.
---- Changes since 1.170 ----
Added Module Config option to display quota percentages, and mark those that are over some limit (thanks to Christophe Chisogne).
---- Changes since 1.210 ----
When editing user and group quotas, you can now select the units they are in, rather than always entering in kB.
The email message sent to users who are over quota can now be modified on the Module Config page.
---- Changes since 1.240 ----
Added the $GRACE parameter to the over-quota email template.
---- Changes since 1.260 ----
Added checkboxes and a button to the user and group quota lists, for updating the block and file limits of multiple users and groups at once.
---- Changes since 1.270 ----
Added a Module Config option for sorting users and groups by hard and soft quotas.
---- Changes since 1.280 ----
Added the ability to send email to managers of groups that are approaching or have exceeded their disk quotas.
---- Changes since 1.290 ----
On Linux systems, edquota is called with UIDs and GIDs instead of user and group names. This allows users with numeric usernames to be edited.
---- Changes since 1.310 ----
Added a Module Config option for sorting user and group quotas by the percentage of their hard limit in use.
---- Changes since 1.330 ----
On Linux systems with the setquota command, it is called instead of edquota to change user and group quotas.
---- Changes since 1.340 ----
Added a Module Config option to sort user lists by the percentage of soft quota used.
---- Changes since 1.350 ----
Added a Module Config option to show both hard and/or soft quota percentages.
---- Changes since 1.380 ----
Quotas are considered active for a filesystem if the usrquota or grpquota options are on in /etc/mtab, even if missing from /etc/fstab.
---- Changes since 1.400 ----
If a user to email is a Virtualmin domain owner, send email to the domain's contact address.
---- Changes since 1.430 ----
Email to users and groups who are over quota on some filesystem can also be Cc'd to another address, such as the system administrator.
---- Changes since 1.440 ----
Converted all pages to use the new Webmin UI library, for a more consistent look. Also split the Filesystem Quotas page into tabs.
Converted commands in the module's API file to POD format, and added more details about each function.
---- Changes since 1.470 ----
Added a module access control option to restrict allowed groups by GID range.
---- Changes since 1.530 ----
Added a Module Config option to hide quotas for deleted users and groups.
---- Changes since 1.660 ----
On Linux, all filesystems that can potentially support quotas are now shown, with a link to turn on quota support. This avoids the need to first turn on quotas in the Disk and Network Filesystems module.
---- Changes since 1.690 ----
Added support for XFS filesystems on Linux, which is the new default on CentOS 7.
